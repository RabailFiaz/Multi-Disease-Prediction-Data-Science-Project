# Multi-Disease-Prediction-Data-Science-Project

Welcome to the Multi-Disease Prediction Model repository! This project features a web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of three critical diseases: Parkinson's Disease, Heart Disease, and Diabetes. The app utilizes machine learning models and Kaggle datasets to provide users with a straightforward and effective tool for early disease detection.

**Introduction**
<br>
Early detection of diseases like Parkinson's, heart disease, and diabetes can significantly enhance treatment outcomes. This project aims to build predictive models using machine learning algorithms and deploy them through a user-friendly Streamlit web application.

**Features**
<ol>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.</li>
<li>Multi-Disease Prediction: Supports prediction for Parkinson's Disease, Heart Disease, and Diabetes.</li>
<li>Interactive Visualizations: Displays results with clear and interactive charts.</li>
<li>Custom Input: Allows users to input their own medical data for prediction.</li>
</ol>

<br>

**Dataset**
<br>
The datasets used in this project are sourced from Kaggle:
<ul>
<li>Parkinson's Disease Dataset: Biomedical voice measurements used to identify Parkinson's disease.
Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Data Set</li>
<li>Heart Disease Dataset: Medical attributes used to predict heart disease.
Heart Disease UCI</li>
<li>Diabetes Dataset: Medical information from patients used to predict diabetes.
Pima Indians Diabetes Database</li>
</ul>

**Installation**
<br>
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
<br>

<ul>
  
<li>Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RabailFiaz/multi-disease-prediction.git</li>

<li>Navigate to the project directory:
cd multi-disease-prediction</li>

<li>Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt</li>

<li>Install Streamlit:
pip install streamlit</li>
</ul>

**Usage**
<ul>
To run the Streamlit web application:
<li>Run the Streamlit App:
streamlit run app.py</li>
  <li>
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.</li>

<li>Input Data: Use the provided interface to input your medical data.</li>

<li>View Predictions: The application will display the predicted likelihood of each disease along with relevant visualizations.</li>
</ul>


**Results**
<br>
The application uses pre-trained machine learning models. The performance of each model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can find detailed evaluation results in the results directory.
